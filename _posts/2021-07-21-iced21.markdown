Conducted with the Technical University of Denmark, this study examines how novice teams evaluate prototyping success during a 10-day makeathon. Prototypes targeting feasibility and solution validation were rated more successful than those focused on desirability or problem validation — with communication, decision support, and tangibility emerging as key success indicators.
