The article examines how novice design teams perceive the success of their prototyping activities during a 10-day makeathon. The study finds that prototypes aimed at feasibility and solution validation are seen as more successful compared to those focused on desirability and problem validation. Key indicators of successful prototypes include their ability to aid in communication, decision-making, learning, and enhancing tangibility. The research highlights the importance of clear outcomes from prototypes to progress projects and suggests that guidance should focus on helping teams identify and use early-stage prototyping outcomes effectively.
