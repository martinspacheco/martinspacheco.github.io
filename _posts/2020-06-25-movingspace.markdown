A nine-month industry project with BMW Group, UnternehmerTUM Makerspace, and Stanglmeier Touristik developing a novel use case for autonomous vehicles. A sensor box was integrated to sync real-time vehicle dynamics with VR activities, enabling physical exercise and reducing motion sickness. The solution was tested with multiple users.
