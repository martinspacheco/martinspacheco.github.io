Moving space is a industry development project together with BMW Group, UnternehmerTUM Makerspace, and Stanglmeier Touristik with the aim of developing a novel use-case for autonomous vehicles (AV). To enable physical excercises and reduce motion sickness, a sensor-box was integrated to sync real-time vehicle dynamics with VR activities, enhancing user engagement. The solution was tested with multiple users providing valuable feedback.
