First prize winner at the Beta Hackathon at ZKM. Developed Revolut.io — a crowd-based innovation platform combining community-driven ideation with social responsibility. My contributions: UI/UX design and business model development. The concept targeted sustainable solutions for everyday problems such as reducing disposable coffee cup waste.
