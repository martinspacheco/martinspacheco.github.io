Doctoral dissertation introducing a hackathon approach for design education in engineering. Implemented in an academic hackathon to measure team effort, product concept quality, and learning effect. Found a significant positive correlation between effort in the solution phase and product concept quality, with no correlation found for the problem phase — pointing to the solution phase as the critical window for outcome quality.
