The article introduces the “Prototyping Planner,” a tool designed to foster a structured prototyping mindset in novice designers. It outlines the development, testing, and evaluation of the tool over two years with 20 design teams. The main findings indicate that the Prototyping Planner helps novice designers create purposeful prototypes and evaluate results, though its efficiency in prototyping and ease of use received mixed feedback. Overall, the tool is seen as beneficial for teaching formal prototyping practices and enhancing documentation and communication of prototyping activities
