I led, managed, and coached the two-week course TMS designed to foster innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students. Participants work in cross-functional teams to tackle real-world problems while collaborating to design, prototype, test and deliver a minimum viable product (MVP). The course has been instrumental in bridging academic knowledge and practical application, providing students with a platform to innovate and explore entrepreneurial ventures. There are several success stories that started a venture after the course with the original idea from the course (e.g., Angsa Robotics, Brainamics, Kewazo, Hawa Dawa, Beworm, Solos)
