The article presents the PETRA framework to guide start-ups through the fuzzy front-end of product development. Applied in a case study with robotics startup, PETRA improves resource allocation, team organization, and the development process, leading to a clear roadmap for achieving a minimum viable product (MVP). Key elements include role-based prototyping and iterative cycles with a Protoban for planning. The framework enhances efficiency and effectiveness in early-stage product development and is adaptable to various start-ups and products.
