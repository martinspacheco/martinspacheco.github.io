I worked in a team to develop an innovative piano training tool using Microsoft HoloLens. The HoloLens displayed the content to play, while exoskeleton gloves provided vibrating indications for which fingers to use. This augmented reality piano trainer was tested with piano teachers and involved multiple user testing sessions to refine the user experience. Our goal was to create an engaging and intuitive learning tool for piano students by combining augmented reality with haptic feedback technology. My main part was developing and building the functional gloves for the users.
