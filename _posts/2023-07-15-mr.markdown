I mentored and worked closely with a student on a master thesis project focused on developing a mixed reality 1:1 vehicle prototype. This prototype, equipped with surrounding screens and sound, was designed to test the optimal positioning and content necessary for an infotainment system in road-based public transport. We tested and evaluated different versions of the infotainment system with various users to gather feedback on user preferences and interaction. This comprehensive evaluation provided valuable insights that guided our decisions on the most effective screen placement and content presentation for enhancing the user experience in public transport.
