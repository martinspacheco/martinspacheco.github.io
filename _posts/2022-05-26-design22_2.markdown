The article together with the Imperial College London (ICL) examines the impact of remote work on prototyping activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study used a double diamond approach to guide four student teams through the design process remotely, utilizing various tools such as VR and collaborative platforms. The main result highlights that while remote tools facilitated communication and initial design stages, significant challenges arose in physical prototyping due to limited access to tools and infrastructure. The study underscores the need for improved integration of digital tools to enhance remote collaboration and prototyping effectiveness.
