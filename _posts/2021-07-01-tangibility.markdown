I managed and led the Tangibility project, a collaborative initiative between TUM and Imperial College London aimed at developing innovative Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces and enhancing remote multidisciplinary collaboration. I oversaw mixed teams of students from both institutions, coordinating activities, organizing project reviews, and providing expert guidance. Our efforts resulted in the successful development and prototyping of four unique VR applications: (1) a novel biopsy training tool in VR-AR for medical students, (2) a VR-controller interface for board sport games, (3) a VR-controller interface for remote ballroom dance practice, and (4) a multisensory, weather-simulating user experience for VR headsets.
