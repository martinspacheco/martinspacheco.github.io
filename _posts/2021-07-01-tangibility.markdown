Led the Tangibility project — a TUM and Imperial College London collaboration developing innovative VR interfaces and remote multidisciplinary workflows. Mixed student teams produced four prototypes: a VR/AR biopsy training tool, a VR controller for board sports, a VR interface for remote ballroom dance, and a multisensory weather-simulating VR experience.
