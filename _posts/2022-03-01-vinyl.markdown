I designed and built a custom vinyl shelf because I couldnâ€™t find one that suited my needs. I selected bamboo wood for its durability and aesthetic appeal and then went to a wood workshop to construct the shelf. The result is a personalized and functional shelf that perfectly fits my vinyl collection.
