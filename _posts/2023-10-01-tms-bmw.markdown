TMS is a one-week design sprint, hosted by BMW Group. I organized and coached cross-functional teams by supporting teams to develop with a problem-focused approach novel solutions (e.g., user experiences, potentials of new technologies, or current challenges). This helps to address novel topics as part of the organisation to stay competitive (e.g., Metaverse).
