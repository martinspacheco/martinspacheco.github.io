<p>Olá! I'm Miguel, and I design how people collaborate with intelligent systems.</p>

<p>As a Senior Researcher at <a href="https://www.siemens.com/">Siemens AG</a>, I develop multi-agent AI paradigms, orchestration concepts, and explainability frameworks that shape standards for AI products and platforms.</p>

<p>I hold a Dr.-Ing. from <a href="https://www.tum.de/">TU Munich</a> (2024), where I led the <a href="https://www.tms.tum.de/">THINK. MAKE. START.</a> programme, managed the €1.3M <a href="https://mcube-cluster.de/projekt/steam/">MCube STEAM</a> project showcased at IAA Mobility 2023, and supervised around 50 student and PhD theses.</p>

<p>Outside of work: espresso, cooking, vinyl, analog photography, road biking, and hiking in the Alps.</p>
